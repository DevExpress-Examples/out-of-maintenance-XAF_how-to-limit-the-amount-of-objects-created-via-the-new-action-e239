<p>This example demonstrates how to limit the number of objects that an end-user can create using the New Action. Assume you are using a Task business class from the Business Class Library. When creating a new Task via the New Action, the count of existing Task objects will be checked, and an end-user won't be allowed to create additional objects, if there are already three objects.</p><p>See code in the MyController.cs (MyController.vb) file. For details, refer to the <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#Xaf/CustomDocument2913">How to: Limit the Amount of Objects Created via the New Action</a> topic in XAF documentation.</p>
